However, accessibility is a major concern (20/30); while entrances may be wheelchair accessible, the extreme crowds on the street and within bars will make navigation difficult for a walker and contradict the 'not ok with much walking' preference.

Broadway honky-tonks are often extremely crowded and loud, making internal navigation and finding comfortable seating challenging and far from a 'relaxed pace.'
