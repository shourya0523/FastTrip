# AccessibleTravel AI - Hackathon Development Rules

## Project Context
You are working on AccessibleTravel AI, an AI-powered travel planning platform focused on accessibility-conscious travelers 55+. This is a 48-hour hackathon with 3 developers (2 backend, 1 frontend) working concurrently on skeleton features first, then advanced features.

## Architecture Overview
- Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.9+) with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, Google Places, Amadeus Flights
- Frontend: React 18 + Tailwind CSS with accessibility-first design
- APIs: RESTful with session-based state management (no persistence)
- Target Users: 55+ travelers with mobility considerations
- AI Model: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for conversation processing, itinerary generation, and place scoring

## Development Principles

### Skeleton-First Development
- Prioritize working skeleton features (chat → search → itinerary → export)
- Advanced features (voice, editing, booking) only after skeleton is complete
- Each feature must work end-to-end before moving to next
- Demo-ready code over perfect code

### Accessibility-First Design
- All UI components must support screen readers
- Minimum font size: 18px (1.125rem)
- Color contrast ratio: 4.5:1 minimum
- Large clickable areas (minimum 44px)
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements

### Concurrent Development
- Clear API contracts defined upfront
- Mock-first integration approach
- Independent development paths with shared interfaces
- Hourly synchronization checkpoints

## Code Standards

### Python (Backend)
- Use Python 3.9+ features and type hints
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Descriptive variable names (accessibility_score, not acc_scr)
- Functions under 50 lines when possible
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)
- Functional components with hooks only
- TypeScript for type safety
- Destructuring for props and state
- Arrow functions for callbacks
- Meaningful component names (AccessibilityScore, not AccScore)
- Components under 100 lines when possible
- Tailwind utility classes only (no custom CSS)

### File Naming
- Python: snake_case for files and functions
- JavaScript: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- Descriptive names: flight_extractor.py not fe.py

## API Design Standards

### Request/Response Format
```python
# Always use Pydantic models
class FlightSearchRequest(BaseModel):
    origin: str
    destination: str
    departure_date: date
    accessibility_needs: List[AccessibilityService] = []

class FlightSearchResponse(BaseModel):
    offers: List[FlightOffer]
    accessibility_summary: Dict[str, Any]
    search_id: str
```

### Error Handling
- Structured error responses with helpful messages
- Graceful degradation for API failures
- User-friendly error messages (no stack traces)
- Fallback to mock data when external APIs fail

### Session Management
```python
# Consistent session handling
from app.utils.session_manager import get_session, update_session

session = get_session(session_id)
session['user_preferences'] = preferences
update_session(session_id, session)
```

## Specific Implementation Guidelines

### AI/LLM Integration
- Use structured prompts with clear examples
- Always validate LLM outputs before returning
- Include timeout handling (30 seconds max)
- Cache common responses during development
- Provide fallback responses for failures

### Flight API Integration (Amadeus)
- Use test environment for hackathon
- Implement proper OAuth2 flow
- Calculate accessibility scores for all flights
- Handle rate limiting gracefully
- Extract structured data from API responses

### Google Places Integration
- Focus on hotels and activities with accessibility data
- Use Place Details API for comprehensive information
- Filter results by accessibility requirements
- Cache responses to avoid rate limits

### Frontend Components
- Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively
- Implement proper loading states
- Support both mouse and keyboard navigation
- Include ARIA labels and roles
- Test with screen reader compatibility

## Demo-Specific Requirements

### Performance Targets
- Chat response: <3 seconds
- API search: <5 seconds
- Itinerary generation: <10 seconds
- PDF export: <5 seconds
- Page load: <2 seconds

### Reliability Features
- Fallback to mock data if APIs fail
- Graceful error handling with user feedback
- Offline demo mode for presentation
- Multiple demo scenarios prepared

### Presentation Quality
- Large, clear fonts throughout
- High contrast colors
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional export documents
- Clean, uncluttered interface

## Development Workflow

### Commit Standards
- Conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:
- Include context: "feat(flights): add Amadeus accessibility scoring"
- Reference skeleton vs advanced: "feat(skeleton): chat parameter extraction"

### Testing Strategy
- Focus on happy path for demo
- Test with realistic data
- Manual testing over unit tests for speed
- Integration testing at checkpoints

### Code Reviews
- Quick reviews for API contracts
- Focus on integration points
- Don't block on style during hackathon
- Pair programming for complex features

## Emergency Protocols

### If APIs Fail
1. Switch to mock responses immediately
2. Inform team via shared channel
3. Continue development with realistic data
4. Document what would work with real APIs

### If Behind Schedule
1. Cut advanced features immediately
2. Focus on skeleton demo readiness
3. Use pre-generated data for demo
4. Simplify UI to basic functional version

### If Integration Breaks
1. Isolate the problem quickly
2. Use mock data to unblock others
3. Parallel debug while development continues
4. Have backup demo ready

## API Contracts (Enforced)

### Chat Endpoint
```python
POST /api/chat
Request: {"message": str, "session_id": str}
Response: {
    "extracted_params": Dict[str, Any],
    "follow_up_questions": List[str],
    "session_id": str
}
```

### Search Endpoint
```python
POST /api/search
Request: {"preferences": Dict, "session_id": str}
Response: {
    "flights": List[FlightOffer],
    "hotels": List[HotelOffer],
    "activities": List[ActivityOffer],
    "session_id": str
}
```

### Itinerary Generation
```python
POST /api/generate-itinerary
Request: {"search_results": Dict, "session_id": str}
Response: {
    "itinerary": ItineraryResponse,
    "accessibility_summary": Dict[str, Any],
    "session_id": str
}
```

## Accessibility Scoring System

### Scoring Criteria (0-10 scale)
- Direct flights: +2 points
- Wheelchair accessible venues: +2 points
- Ground floor access: +1.5 points
- Accessible transportation: +1.5 points
- Short walking distances: +1 point
- Accessible parking: +1 point
- Medical facilities nearby: +0.5 points

### Implementation
```python
def calculate_accessibility_score(item: Dict) -> Tuple[float, List[str]]:
    score = 5.0  # Base score
    notes = []
    
    # Apply scoring criteria
    # Return score (0-10) and explanation notes
    return min(10.0, max(0.0, score)), notes
```

## Mock Data Strategy

### Development Mocks
- Realistic accessibility data for NYC
- Varied accessibility scores (3-9 range)
- Multiple options for each category
- Consistent data structure across all APIs

### Demo Mocks
- Curated "perfect" accessibility scenarios
- Predetermined user personas
- Reliable demonstration data
- Fallback for all API endpoints

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- API response time <5 seconds
- Accessibility score accuracy >90%
- Demo completion rate 100%
- Error rate <5%

### UX Metrics
- Font size ≥18px throughout
- Color contrast ≥4.5:1
- Clickable areas ≥44px

## Communication Rules

### Hourly Updates
- Current task and status
- Blockers and dependencies
- ETA for current milestone
- Help needed (if any)

### API Changes
- All changes must be announced
- Team approval for breaking changes
- Update shared contracts immediately

### Help Protocol
- Ask for help after 15 minutes stuck
- Share screens for complex issues
- Pair program for critical features
- Escalate to team lead if needed

Remember: The goal is a working, impressive demo that showcases AI-powered accessibility travel planning. Prioritize working features over perfect code, and always consider the accessibility needs of your target users.
